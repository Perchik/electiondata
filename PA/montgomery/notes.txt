open "2024 General Election Results - Department of State PA"  which is a giant pdf

Downloaded full pdf, found the pages that were for the following races:

63-423 president
423-566 senate
567-711 atty general
999-1147 congress reps

wrote python script to find "Vote for" and split the pdf at that point.

this created the split_sections/ pdfs, one for each race

parsepdf.py handles each of those files and generates individual csvs for each page, then joins all those together.

generate_final_csv.py takes the merged csvs and reformats them to the same structure as other counties.
